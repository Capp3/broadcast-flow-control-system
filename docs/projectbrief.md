# Broadcast Management System - Project Brief

## Project Overview

The Broadcast Management System (BMS) is a comprehensive platform designed for media organizations to manage broadcast content, scheduling, and operations. The system enables broadcasters to efficiently organize content, create and maintain broadcast schedules, manage user permissions, and automate various aspects of the broadcasting workflow.

## Business Objectives

1. Streamline the management of broadcast content and scheduling
2. Reduce manual effort and human error in broadcast operations
3. Provide real-time visibility into broadcast schedules and content status
4. Enable efficient collaboration between different roles in broadcast organizations
5. Support compliance with broadcasting regulations through proper logging and audit trails
6. Integrate with external systems for content acquisition and playout

## Target Users

1. **Content Managers**: Responsible for organizing and managing broadcast content
2. **Broadcast Schedulers**: Create and maintain broadcast schedules
3. **Technical Operators**: Handle technical aspects of broadcasting
4. **Station Managers**: Oversee overall broadcast operations
5. **Administrators**: Manage system settings and user permissions

## Core Functional Requirements

- Regular security updates
- Audit logging for all critical operations

### 4. Reliability

- 99.9% uptime goal
- Automated backups
- Error handling and logging
- Failover capabilities
- Monitoring and alerting

### 5. Compatibility

- Support for modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Responsive design for mobile and tablet access
- API compatibility with industry standard systems

## Non-functional Requirements

### 1. Usability

- Intuitive user interface
- Contextual help and tooltips
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Consistent design language
- Quick access to frequently used functions

### 2. Maintainability

- Well-documented code
- Automated tests with high coverage
- Modular architecture
- Consistent coding standards
- Comprehensive technical documentation

### 3. Localization

- Multi-language support
- Time zone handling
- Support for different date/time formats
- Currency formatting for financial aspects

### 4. Accessibility

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Screen reader compatibility

## Success Criteria

1. System meets all functional and non-functional requirements
2. User acceptance testing passes with 90%+ approval
3. Performance metrics meet or exceed targets
4. Security audit passes with no critical findings
5. System can be deployed and maintained with documented procedures
