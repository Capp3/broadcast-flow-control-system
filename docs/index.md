# Broadcast Management System Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Broadcast Management System (BMS). This documentation covers both the frontend React application and the backend Django implementation.

## Overview

The Broadcast Management System is a comprehensive platform designed for media organizations to manage broadcast content, scheduling, and operations. The system enables broadcasters to efficiently organize content, create and maintain broadcast schedules, manage user permissions, and automate various aspects of the broadcasting workflow.
