# Backend Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document serves as an index for all documentation related to the implementation of the Django-based backend for the Broadcast Management System. The backend will be containerized using Docker and will use PostgreSQL as the database.

## Table of Contents

### 1. [Backend Implementation Plan](backend-implementation-plan.md)

Comprehensive overview of the backend implementation strategy, including architecture, phases, technical details, and risk management.

### 2. [Docker Configuration Guide](docker-configuration.md)

Detailed information about the Docker infrastructure, including:
- Docker Compose configuration for development and production
- Dockerfile configurations
- Environment setup
- Service dependencies

### 3. [Django Models Design](django-models.md)

Complete database schema design, including:
- Entity-relationship diagram
- Model definitions
- Relationships
- Field types and validation
- Serializer examples

### 4. [API Endpoints Design](api-endpoints.md)

Documentation of all REST API endpoints, including:
- Authentication endpoints
- CRUD operations for all entities
- Request and response formats
- Filtering and pagination
- Authentication and permissions

### 5. [Implementation Timeline](implementation-timeline.md)

Detailed timeline for the backend implementation, including:
- Phase breakdown
- Weekly tasks
- Resource allocation
- Milestones and deliverables
- Risk mitigation strategies

## How to Use This Documentation

1. Start with the [Backend Implementation Plan](backend-implementation-plan.md) to understand the overall strategy
2. Review the [Django Models Design](django-models.md) to understand the data structure
3. Examine the [API Endpoints Design](api-endpoints.md) to see how the frontend will interact with the backend
4. Use the [Docker Configuration Guide](docker-configuration.md) for setting up the development environment
5. Follow the [Implementation Timeline](implementation-timeline.md) to track progress through the project

## Development Setup

To set up the development environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/broadcast.git
cd broadcast

# Copy environment files
cp .env.example .env.dev
cp .env.db.example .env.db

# Start the Docker containers
docker-compose up -d

# Apply migrations
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate

# Create a superuser
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Contributing

When contributing to the backend codebase, please ensure:

1. All new features have appropriate tests
2. Model changes include migrations
3. API endpoints are documented
4. Docker configurations are tested
5. Code follows the project's style guide
