# Backend Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document serves as an index for all documentation related to the implementation of the Django-based backend for the Broadcast Management System. The backend is containerized using Docker with Docker Compose and uses PostgreSQL as the database, Redis for caching, and Celery for task processing.

## Current Implementation Status

## Development Setup

To set up the development environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/broadcast.git
cd broadcast

# Copy environment files
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env

# Start the Docker containers
cd backend
docker-compose up -d

# Apply migrations
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate

# Create a superuser
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Docker Compose Services

The backend consists of the following containerized services:

1. **Web**: Django application server
2. **DB**: PostgreSQL database
3. **Redis**: Redis cache and session store
4. **Celery**: Celery worker for task processing
5. **Celery-beat**: Celery beat for scheduled tasks
6. **Nginx**: Web server for production deployment (production only)

## API Authentication

The backend uses session-based authentication with CSRF protection. The authentication flow is as follows:

1. Client sends credentials to login endpoint
2. Server validates credentials and creates session
3. Server returns session cookie and CSRF token
4. Client includes session cookie and CSRF token in subsequent requests

## Contributing

When contributing to the backend codebase, please ensure:

1. All new features have appropriate tests
2. Model changes include migrations
3. API endpoints are documented
4. Docker configurations are tested
5. Code follows the project's style guide
