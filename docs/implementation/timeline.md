## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| **Authentication compatibility issues** | Medium | High | Allocate extra time for authentication integration; create fallback auth mechanism |
| **API contract mismatches** | Medium | High | Comprehensive review of frontend expectations; create thorough tests |
| **Database performance issues** | Low | Medium | Early performance testing; implement proper indexing |
| **Docker configuration issues** | Low | Medium | Use well-tested configurations; create debug documentation |
| **Integration delays** | Medium | Medium | Schedule buffer time for integration; prioritize core functionality |

## Resource Allocation

### Team Structure

- 1 Backend Developer (Django/Python)
- 1 DevOps Engineer (part-time for Docker configuration)
- 1 QA Engineer (part-time for testing)

### Resource Distribution

| Phase | Backend Developer | DevOps Engineer | QA Engineer |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| Phase 1 | 50% | 50% | - |
| Phase 2 | 100% | 10% | - |
| Phase 3 | 70% | 10% | 20% |
| Phase 4 | 50% | 30% | 20% |

## Milestones and Progress Tracking

### Key Milestones

1. **M1**: Docker environment fully configured (End of Week 2)
2. **M2**: Django models and core APIs implemented (End of Week 5)
3. **M3**: All API endpoints completed and tested (End of Week 8)
4. **M4**: System deployed to production (End of Week 11)

### Progress Tracking

Progress will be tracked using:

1. Weekly status reports
2. GitHub project board with task tracking
3. Milestone completion reviews
4. Daily standup meetings during critical integration phases
