# Active Context

## Current Focus

**Documentation Update**: Comprehensive update of all project documentation to reflect the current state of the Django backend and Lovable-developed frontend with GitHub synchronization for self-hosting. Removing outdated information, eliminating duplicate content, and ensuring consistency across all documentation.

## Current Task

**Task ID**: TASK-003
**Task Type**: Documentation
**Status**: Implementation Phase ðŸš§

### Progress

- Creative phase completed with documentation architecture design
- Dual Documentation Structure approach selected and implemented
- README.md updated with current project structure and technology stack
- MkDocs configuration updated to reflect actual content
- Lovable integration documentation created with self-hosting options
- Main documentation index updated with current project status
- Backend implementation index updated with current status
- Memory-bank files updated to reflect current task

### Next Steps

1. Update frontend documentation to accurately describe Lovable integration with GitHub for self-hosting
2. Ensure consistent terminology and references across all documentation
3. Remove duplicate or outdated information
4. Build and test documentation with MkDocs locally

## System Context

The Broadcast Management System consists of:

1. **Frontend**:

   - React application developed through the Lovable platform
   - Code synchronized to GitHub for local development and self-hosting
   - Can be deployed either through Lovable or self-hosted from the GitHub repo

2. **Backend**: Django-based backend with the following components:
   - Django REST Framework for API endpoints
   - PostgreSQL for data storage
   - Redis for caching and session storage
   - Celery for task processing
   - Docker Compose for containerization

Current implementation focus is on completing the Django backend while ensuring documentation accurately reflects the system's architecture, implementation status, and development/deployment options.
