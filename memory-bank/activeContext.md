# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is to ensure the frontend continues to work well without a backend. Any changes or enhancements to the system should preserve the existing UI and functionality.

## Frontend Status

The frontend is currently operational with the following features working:
- User interface with responsive design
- Navigation and routing between pages
- Form components with validation
- Data display components
- Mock authentication flow

## Implementation Strategy

For the immediate term:
1. Document the existing frontend structure and API expectations
2. Identify any frontend-only enhancements that could be made without backend changes
3. Plan for a backend implementation that respects the existing API contract

## Key Considerations

- **Frontend Preservation**: Keep the frontend as intact as possible in its current working state
- **API Compatibility**: Ensure any backend implementation matches the expected API contracts
- **Incremental Development**: Focus on incremental improvements that don't break existing functionality
- **Testing**: Maintain comprehensive testing to ensure frontend functionality is preserved

## Next Steps

1. Complete the documentation of the existing system
2. Identify any critical UI/UX issues that can be addressed without backend changes
3. Develop a plan for backend implementation (if needed) that works with the existing frontend
