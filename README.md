- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **Development Platform**: [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/78845865-e6be-426e-99f7-3b3cc01b4991) (with code synchronized to GitHub)

### Backend

- **Framework**: Django 4.2 with Django REST Framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14

## Getting Started

### Frontend Development Options

#### Option 1: Using Lovable Platform

The frontend can be developed through the Lovable development platform. Visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/78845865-e6be-426e-99f7-3b3cc01b4991) and start developing.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to the GitHub repository.

#### Option 2: Self-Hosted Local Development (Recommended for Production)

For local development and self-hosting:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Navigate to the project directory
cd broadcast

# Install the frontend dependencies
npm i

# Start the frontend development server
npm run dev
```

This approach allows you to work directly with the code that Lovable synchronizes to GitHub and gives you full control over your deployment and hosting.

### Backend Development

```sh
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Copy environment files
cp .env.example .env

# Start the Docker containers
docker-compose up -d

# Apply migrations
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate

# Create a superuser
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the `docs/` directory and can be built using MkDocs:

```sh
# Install documentation dependencies
pip install -r requirements-docs.txt

# Serve documentation locally
mkdocs serve
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` to view the documentation.

## Deployment

### Frontend Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Lovable Deployment

Open [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/78845865-e6be-426e-99f7-3b3cc01b4991) and click on Share -> Publish to deploy the frontend through Lovable's platform.

#### Option 2: Self-Hosted Deployment (Recommended for Production)

For complete control over your hosting environment:

```sh
# Build the frontend
npm run build

# Deploy the built files from the dist/ directory to your hosting provider
```

This approach gives you full control over your hosting environment and deployment pipeline.

### Backend Deployment

The backend is containerized with Docker and can be deployed to any container-compatible hosting environment.

```sh
# Production deployment
cd backend
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

## Development Status

The project is currently in active development:

- âœ… Frontend development with Lovable platform (with GitHub synchronization)
- ðŸš§ Backend implementation with Django and Docker
- âœ… Documentation system with MkDocs

For detailed information about the development status and upcoming tasks, refer to the project documentation.
